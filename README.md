#Blip8

A CHIP-8 interpreter written in Java. Bits and pieces borrowed from [my GameBoy emulator.](https://bitbucket.org/alex_newkirk/tailspindmg)

Designed against the CHIP-8 specification as described in [the Wikipedia article.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8)

Should have full compatibility with any _pure_ CHIP-8 ROM (any ROM that does not contain any RCA 1802 machine code).
